# Maximum-Matching-for-Bipartite-Graph
Implementation of an algorithm to determine the maximum matching in a bipartite graph and if that matching is perfect (all nodes are matched).

## Optimal Algorithm for determining the Maximum Matching in a Bipartite Graph

### Problem Description
The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each instance, there will be 3 positive integers m, n, and q. Numbers m and n are the number of nodes in node set A and node set B. Number q is the number of edges in the bipartite graph. For each edge, there will be 2 more positive integers i, and j representing an edge between node 1 ≤ i ≤ m in A and node 1 ≤ j ≤ n in B.
